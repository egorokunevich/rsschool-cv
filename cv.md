## About me
This is not the first time I try to learn programming. There were several attempts before, and last time I did well in mastering my CSS and HTML skills. Though, i don't consider my code clean. Now I would like to finish this adventure, and I'll try my best to complete this course. I believe that programming is such a potential, interesting and motivating profession. To my opinion it's also very inspiring.

## Skills
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Code example
This is a piece of code for a slider in **JS**:
<pre>
    <b>function</b> changePosition() {
      sliderWidth = slider.clientWidth;
      position = `translateX(-${sliderIndex * sliderWidth}px)`;
      <b>for</b> (<b>let</b> i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) {
        slides[i].style.transform = position;
      }
    }
</pre>
